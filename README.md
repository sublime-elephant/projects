# Welcome to my github.

* "C stuff" features my projects I've done in the C programming language
  * **[LoadDLL.c](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/C%20stuff/LoadDLL.c)**
  * **[badDLL.c](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/C%20stuff/badDLL.c)**
  * **[computername.c](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/C%20stuff/computername.c)**
  * and **[hijacker.c](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/C%20stuff/hijacker.c)** are my forays into DLL Injection.
    
  * **[hoodirony.c](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/C%20stuff/hoodirony.c)** is a prank program I made that plays audio and video randomly throughout the day. Ironically, it has been one of my most involved projects, since I was targetting an old platform, Windows Embedded Standard 7, and thus using hopelessly archaic technologies like DirectShow, and ASF multimedia containers and WMA/WMV2 codecs.
  * **[linearMatrix.c](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/C%20stuff/linearMatrix.c)** is a C program that employs algorithms to solve sets of linear equations using the Gauss-Jordan row reduction method. It does it quickly and efficiently. I set a challenge for myself to rely on pointers where I could. The resulting code is quite unreadable and I'm proud of it. ChatGPT hates this guy.
  * **[memory.c](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/C%20stuff/memory.c)** is a quite involved project that queries and interrogates process memory on-demand. It identifies the process you want to interrogate and does all the memory allocation, query, examination and other operations required to present you with a human-readable layout of program memory. I think it has functionality to search for text-strings, too.
  * **[photocat.c](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/C%20stuff/photocat.c) is like hoodirony.c, but a more lowkey version that only plays funny sounds and flashes a picture of a cat on the screen.
