* "C stuff" features my projects I've done in the C programming language. Everything you see is in-house C; I never use external libraries, with the exception of the WINAPI. Other than that every single aspect of a program is done by me and me alone.
  * **[LoadDLL.c](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/C%20stuff/LoadDLL.c)**, **[badDLL.c](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/C%20stuff/badDLL.c)**, **[computername.c](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/C%20stuff/computername.c)**, and **[hijacker.c](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/C%20stuff/hijacker.c)** are my forays into DLL Injection.
    
  * **[hoodirony.c](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/C%20stuff/hoodirony.c)** is a prank program I made that plays audio and video randomly throughout the day. Ironically, it has been one of my most involved projects, since I was targetting an old platform, Windows Embedded Standard 7, and thus using hopelessly archaic technologies like DirectShow, and ASF multimedia containers and WMA/WMV2 codecs. 
  * **[linearMatrix.c](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/C%20stuff/linearMatrix.c)** is a C program that employs matrix algorithms to solve sets of linear equations using the Gauss-Jordan matrix row reduction method. It does it quickly and efficiently. I set a challenge for myself to rely on pointers where I could. The resulting code is quite unreadable and I'm proud of it. ChatGPT hates this guy.
  * **[memory.c](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/C%20stuff/memory.c)** is a quite involved project that queries and interrogates process memory on-demand. It identifies the process you want to interrogate and does all the memory allocation, query, examination and other operations required to present you with a human-readable layout of program memory. It has functionality to search for text-strings, too.
  * **[photocat.c](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/C%20stuff/photocat.c)** is like hoodirony.c, but a more lowkey version that only plays sounds and flashes an image on screen. You must compile the resources yourself.
  * **[weather.c](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/C%20stuff/weather.c)** An old project I used to web-scrape the weather data from Australia's Bureau of Meteorology to be aggregated in a database for statistical analysis.



* "Python stuff" features my projects I've done in the Python programming language
  * **[KasiskiAnalysis.py](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/Python%20stuff/KasiskiAnalysis.py)** is a project that attempts to employ Kasiski analysis on polyalphabetic substitution ciphers. It is a beautiful method for cryptanalysis of ciphers created by systems like the Vigenère cipher.
  * **[PuzzleSolver.py](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/Python%20stuff/PuzzleSolver.py)** is a project I made to bruteforce the solution to a physical puzzle I received as a gift from a family friend. It works. If you want proof that nothing in this repository is from generative language models, check this one out for some serious programmer gore. You have been warned.
  * **[bluecurve.py](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/Python%20stuff/bluecurve.py)**, **[primegraph.py](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/Python%20stuff/primegraph.py)**, **[primelines.py](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/Python%20stuff/primelines.py)** are all python projects from a curious phase I had of wanting to graph some lines and have them react to prime numbers.
  * **[caesaring.py](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/Python%20stuff/caesaring.py)** is a simple script that allows you to instantly bruteforce all 26 possible combinations of  a fixed-rotation monoalphabetic substitution cipher, like the Caesar cipher.
  * **[keylogger_test.py](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/Python%20stuff/keylogger_test.py)** is a WIP on keylogging.
  * **[netcat.py](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/Python%20stuff/netcat.pt)**, **[reverseshellclient.py](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/Python%20stuff/reverseshellclient.py)**, **[reverseshellserver](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/Python%20stuff/reverseshellserver.py), [shellconnectTCP.py](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/Python%20stuff/shellconnectTCP.py)**, **[simpleshellserverTCP.py](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/Python%20stuff/simpleshellserverTCP.py)**, **[simpletcpserverforproxy.py](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/Python%20stuff/simpletcpserverforproxy.py)**, **[proxy.py](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/Python%20stuff/proxy.py)** are all the projects **every** budding cyber-security professional has on their hard drive somewhere. You know _you_ do. I have included them here as a tithe to the programming world.
  * **[packetsniff.py](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/blob/main/Python%20stuff/packetsniff.py)** is a rudimentary packet sniffer. This project taught me a lot of things like how to use wireshark instead.

* "web" features my HTML oriented projects
  *  [RC4](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/tree/main/web/RC4) is a web project that features a fully working - and properly initialised - RC4 cipher with encryption and decryption.
  *  [gravity](https://github.com/sublime-elephant/projects/tree/main/web/gravity) is a web project that simply tries to simulate a bouncing ball in a container with effects of gravity and air resistance accounted for. A bit of fun.
